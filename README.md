# Challenge: Shopping basket

By using only Vue.js and no other dependencies, create a small application that handles like a shopping basket.
Upload to CodeSandbox, JSFiddle or similar to share the application when done.

Requirements:
- Show a list of clickable items (ie. foods like burger, pizza, pasta etc)
- When clicking on an item, the item should be added to the shopping basket
- If the item already exists in the shopping basket, the item should only be shown only once and with a number indicating the quantity of that item
- It should be possible to add and remove items from the shopping basket one by one (ie with +/- buttons)
- It should be possible to clear the whole shopping basket
- Each item should have a unique price and the shopping basket should always show the total amount of the value of the items in the basket

Happy coding!
